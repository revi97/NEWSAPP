# NEWSAPP
 A android app which is used to access news and show them with the help of API key..  
 Best of all it built with dark mode in mind so it has black background.  
 
 
This is an android app which I built for my college project.  
This has a search feature also which helps to search even a specific keyword or a sentence.  
This has everything needed to build the app except the API key.  
 
 ![API_KEY_PLACEMENT](https://github.com/revi97/NEWSAPP/blob/master/API%20KEY.PNG)
 
 THE place where it says your api key, just add the api key you get from any website which provides the api for developers or whose news you want to access.  
I have used retrofit and picaso libraries with proper latest commands like 'get' instead of 'vith'.  


You can use it however you like.
